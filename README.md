whodunit.c is a program to uncover who has done it. I have been given a 24-bit BMP file representing a picture of who has done it. The picture is covered by a red and white 'noise'. In order to find out who's done it I need to uncover what's underneath that 'noise', so I needed to manipulate the Bitmap.

resize.c is a program to resize BMP files.

recover.c is a program to recover lost data and in this case jpg files.
